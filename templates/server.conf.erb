# 3=TLS debug stuff, up to 11.

# Use a dynamic tun device.  (Could also be tap, for ether bridging.)

# MTU for tunnel (outer) packets.  Over-conservative default 1300, recommended
# is (link_mtu - 28) deducting the UDP header, i.e. 1472 for a standard link 
# of MTU = 1500.  The default seems to work OK in v2.0.
# link-mtu 1472

# Path MTU discovery, should DF (don't fragment) be set? no, maybe, yes.
# "maybe" uses per-route heuristics to decide.
mtu-disc maybe

# Empirically verify the MTU.  Results logged after about 3 minutes.
# Requires equivalent support on the other end.
